Purple Cookie Kush Feminized is a short plant with good yields. Bud formation is dense, similar to many Kush strains.",

No corners were cut in creating and selecting the right breeding stock for this fantastic strain. The result is a well-balanced hybrid that retains key qualities from its lineage. The Purple Kush parent of Purple Cookie Kush Feminized has a lot to contribute, as evidenced by the plant morphology. The compact nature and sturdy branching can be attributed to those indica-dominant genetics. Another area that the indica influence is evident is in the terpene profile, which includes scents of spicy hashish and earthiness."

            "short": "Pure Power Plant Feminized by White Label is a fast-flowering 40% indica, 60% sativa strain. It produces abundant yields, and can be grown indoors, or outdoors in a warm climate. The plants produce a skunky, vanilla-wood aroma while growing, which is also evident in the taste. The sativa dominance results in a talkative, uplifting high.",
            "completion": "White Label Pure Power Plant Feminized cannabis seeds are a potent hybrid; made up of 60% sativa and 40% indica. Its exact genetics have been kept a secret, though it’s known that the sativa parent plant is South African, and the indica originates from the US. The slight sativa dominance is evident in the high, which is energising and euphoric. This is a feminized strain, which means that it’s highly unlikely that any male plants will grow from the seeds. This means cultivation is much easier, making it a suitable option for novice growers. Pure Power Plant Feminized also has high resistance to mould, which is another advantage."
